To date, most discoveries of network subcomponents that implement human-interpretable computations in deep vision models have involved close study of single units and large amounts of human labor. We explore scalable methods for extracting the subgraph of a vision modelâ€™s computational graph that underlies recognition of a specific visual concept. We introduce a new method for identifying these subgraphs: specifying a visual concept using a few examples, and then tracing the interdependence of neuron activations across layers, or their _functional connectivity_. We find that our approach extracts circuits that causally affect model output, and that editing these circuits can defend large pretrained models from adversarial attacks.
